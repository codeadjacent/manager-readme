# Working in han's team

This is not a rule book, but a place to look up and familiarize yourself with my values, beliefs and modus operandi. I hope this readme faciliates and accelerates the initial forming, storming and norming so that we can get to the fun part faster.

## About my current situation

- I drive my daugther to kindergarten each day around 8:30 CET (2pm IST), so 20min before and after, I'm on the road
- I usually start working on 8:45-9am

## Time managment
Time is the only thing we can't get more of, thus I highly value everyone's time and people who respect my time.

I always have dedicated slots reserved each day for my team members. I prefer to have these slots in the morning and after lunch of where I'm based (currently CET) and they are most often used by my team members to "unblock" themselves. 

I usually manage my calendar at least 1 week in advance. If you cannot find an open slot and it is urgent, please don't hesitate to call me.

## 1:1
I like to have a 30min weekly with each of my team members. This is your time, please make it about you, your current status/situtation/growth,... Otherwise my focus will mostly be on your personal development. I prefer not to use this time to talk about operational business, unless there is a need.

## Feedback
I am 100% open for feedback, the timelier the better. If you feel **for whatever reason** you are not able or comfortable to give it to me personally, please do tell it to a colleague or even my team lead. I cannot adapt, if I don't know what to change.

You will receive feedback from me always private in 1:1, praises will always be public (unless you don't want it).

### Giving Feedback

1. Timely - as immediate as the situation and place allows
2. Specific - focus on specifics and behaviours, do not generalize or get personal
3. Constructive - suggest what I would have done differently and why

### Receiving Feedback

1. Clarify, don't justify 
2. Right to discard - feedback is a gift, but it's not always right. Reflect and take what's best for you and discard the rest

# Working in Han's Team

This isn't a rule book, but rather a "user manual" to help you familiarize yourself with my values, beliefs, and how I operate. I hope this guide helps us skip the awkward introductory phase so we can get to the fun part faster.

## About My Schedule

- **The School Run:** I drive my daughter to kindergarten around 8:30 AM CET (2 PM IST). Please expect me to be offline/on the road for about 20 minutes before and after this time.
- **Start Time:** I usually start my work day between 8:45 and 9:00 AM CET.

## Time Management
Time is our most finite resource, so I highly value efficiency and respecting each other's schedules.

I reserve dedicated slots every day specifically for the team. I prefer to schedule these in the morning and after lunch (CET). Please utilize these times to "unblock" yourself if you are stuck.

I usually plan my calendar at least one week in advance. However, if you cannot find an open slot and the matter is urgent, **please do not hesitate to call me.**

## 1:1 Meetings
I schedule a weekly 30-minute sync with each team member. **This is your time.** Please make it about you—your current status, well-being, and career growth.

Unless there is a pressing need, I prefer not to use this time for operational business updates. My goal in these meetings is to focus on your personal development.

## Feedback
I am 100% open to feedback—the timelier, the better.

If you feel unable or uncomfortable giving feedback to me personally for any reason, please share it with a colleague or even my team lead. I cannot adapt if I don't know what needs to change.

**My promise to you:** You will always receive critical feedback from me in private (1:1). Praise will always be public (unless you explicitly ask otherwise).

### Giving Feedback
1.  **Timely:** As immediate as the situation and setting allow.
2.  **Specific:** Focus on specific behaviors and outcomes; please do not generalize or make it personal.
3.  **Constructive:** Suggest what I could have done differently and why.

### Receiving Feedback
1.  **Clarify, don't justify:** Seek to understand the perspective before defending.
2.  **Reflect and filter:** Feedback is a gift, but it’s not always right. Reflect on it, take what is useful for your growth, and discard the rest.
