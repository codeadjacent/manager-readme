# Han's Readme

This is **NOT** a rule book, but rather a "cheat sheet" to help you familiarize yourself with my values, beliefs, and how I operate. I hope this guide helps us accelerate the introductory phase so we can get to the fun part faster.

## General Availability

Some general information to facilitate remote work:

- **Start Time:** I start my work day around 9:00 CET (13:30 IST). Between 8:00 and 9:00 CET, I am driving my daughter to kindergarten. Meetings before 8:00 (12:30 IST) are possible.
- **End Time:** I finish at 17:00 CET (21:30 IST) because I need to cook dinner, though I sometimes continue in the evenings after 21:00.
- **Meetings:** I reserve dedicated slots in my calendar every day specifically for my team—please use them!
- **Teams/Slack:** Notifications are turned off, but I check them regularly. Check out this [medium article](https://medium.com/@hanche2001/the-ux-behind-async-messages-022024348c77) on my thoughts on async messages.
- **Weekly 1:1s:** 30 minutes per week with each team member, focusing on personal development and preferably not on operational business.

## My Values

### How I Communicate

- **I ask "Why?" a lot:** Coming from a product/startup background, I am very curious. If I ask "Why did you do it this way?", I am not criticizing you. I am simply trying to learn from you.
- **Silence is okay:** If I ask a question and you need time to think, that is fine. You can always get back to me later.

### Focus time
I highly value everyone's focus time and people who show respect for mine.

I usually plan my focus times in my calendar at least one week in advance. However, if you cannot find an open slot and the matter is urgent, **please do not hesitate to call me.**

### Feedback
I am 100% open to feedback — the timelier, the better. I will never admonish you for giving me honest feedback. Why would I? You're helping me grow.

If you feel unable or uncomfortable giving feedback to me personally for **any reason**, please share it with a colleague, my team lead, or even HR. I want to know because I cannot adapt if I don't know what needs to change.

**My promise to you:** You will receive frequent, honest, and constructive feedback from me, with the intent to help you grow. Praise will be public, and criticism will always be private.

Here is my mental model on great feedback:

**Giving Feedback**
1.  **Timely:** As immediate as the situation and setting allow.
2.  **Specific:** Focus on specific behaviors and concrete situations, not hypotheticals.
3.  **Subjective:** Suggest what I could have done differently and why, so I can reflect.

**Receiving Feedback**
1.  **Clarify, don't justify:** Seek to understand instead of letting your ego rule.
2.  **Reflect and filter:** Feedback is a gift, but it’s not always right. Reflect on it, take what is useful for your growth, and discard the rest.

This article matches my mental model quite well:

### Ownership & Accountability

**My Philosophy**: You drive, I navigate. I believe you do your best work when you have the freedom to drive your own topics. I want you to feel ownership of your code. However, I know that true ownership requires a safe environment.

**Safety First**

- **Mistakes happen**: We are building complex software. I will never blame you for an honest mistake, but I will hold you accountable for hiding them. I focus on fixing the process, not blaming the person.
- **Bad News Travels Fast:** If something breaks or a deadline is at risk, tell me **immediately**. I am here to help you put out the fire, not to judge you for the spark.
- **Ask for help:** It is not a weakness to ask for help; it is a strength. If you are stuck for more than 1 hour, please reach out.


**Growing into Accountability**
- **Proactive vs. Reactive:** You are the experts on the code you write. If you see a way to improve our code or process, please tell me. I want to hear your ideas.
- **My Role:** My job is to unblock you, provide context, and handle the politics. Your job is to focus on the technology.
